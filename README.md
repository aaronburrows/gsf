## Guitar Song Formatter

### Purpose
Create an intelligent way to format and present guitar chord charts with lyrics, chords, and some meaningful notation.

### Goals
- Simple syntax for reading/writing. Possibly markdown or something similar
- JSON for data transport within the app and between apps
- Create visual layout tools for different display modes/PDF generation/etc.
- Create editor, possibly a visual editor or simply a standardized text format
- Accessible, so that it can be used by hobbyist musicians with no need to code anything
- Chord alignment with bars/beats and with lyrics
- Data-driven so that lyrics can be modified/inserted and keys can be changed with no need to retype or reformat anything

### Notes
There's got to be a better way to display guitar charts for music.

Should be web based, and possibly add the ability to store songs, search for songs by name, artist, meta data, etc., and multiple versions of songs in a meaningful way.

Copyrighted music and lyrics will be a consideration, so we either need a way to import/export local files for quick formatting and printing, or a service-based approach with the ability to store songs in your own account.

The goal should be to create a standard format for song charts, one that can be exported and extended, not a proprietary solution (though a proprietary app or web interface might become a possible goal if there's enough traction/interest.

### ToDo

Licensing? MIT, GPL, Creative Commons, etc.?
